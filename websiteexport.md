## Export summary

1. The site was crawled with `download_site.py` using a headless browser to capture fully rendered HTML and assets.
2. Sitemap URLs were fetched to avoid missing pages that are not linked in navigation.
3. Pages were normalized into:

   - `index.html` (root homepage)
   - `pages/<slug>.html` for all subpages
   - Shared assets in `images\`, `css\`, `scripts\`, `fonts\`, `assets\`

4. HTML and SEO basics were cleaned (doctype, language, meta charset, viewport, titles, descriptions, image alt text).
5. Theme/template mode: none.

## Review checklist

1. Open `C:\ZZZWebsites\www.kenbrownfc.com\index.html` in a browser.
2. Click through all main sections and important flows.
3. Confirm that content, images, CSS, and JS all load as expected.
4. Spot‑check a few pages against the original live site.
5. Confirm titles, descriptions, and alt tags look reasonable.
6. When satisfied, follow `github.md` to commit and push, then `cloudflare.md` to deploy and update DNS.
